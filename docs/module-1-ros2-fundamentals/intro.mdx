# ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robotics

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)—the middleware that enables humanoid robots to coordinate their many software components into coherent autonomous behavior.

## What You'll Learn

- **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding nodes, topics, services, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies
- **Python Development**: Building publishers, subscribers, and service nodes with rclpy
- **Robot Description**: Defining humanoid robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Prerequisites

This module assumes familiarity with:
- Basic Python programming
- Fundamental robotics concepts (sensors, actuators, control)
- Linux command line basics

No prior ROS experience is required—we start from the fundamentals.

## Why ROS 2 for Humanoids?

Humanoid robots are among the most complex robotic systems ever built. A bipedal robot must simultaneously:
- Process sensor data from dozens of joints, cameras, and IMUs
- Plan motions that maintain balance
- React to environmental changes in real-time
- Coordinate arm movements with locomotion

ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that makes this coordination possible. It acts as the robot's "nervous system," enabling independent software components to share data and work together.

## Module Structure

| Chapter | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | ROS 2 as Robotic Nervous System | Nodes, topics, services, QoS |
| 2 | Building ROS 2 Nodes with Python | rclpy, publishers, subscribers |
| 3 | Describing Humanoid Robots with URDF | Links, joints, visualization |
