# The Digital Twin: Gazebo and Unity

This module explores how simulation enables humanoid robot development—creating digital replicas where algorithms can be tested safely and synthetic training data can be generated at scale.

## What You'll Learn

- **Physics Simulation**: How Gazebo models rigid body dynamics, collision detection, and forces
- **Photorealistic Rendering**: Using Unity for visualization and perception training data
- **Sensor Simulation**: Modeling LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs with realistic noise
- **Environment Building**: Creating simulation worlds with SDF and terrain modeling

## Prerequisites

This module builds on:
- [Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](/docs/module-1-ros2-fundamentals/intro) — Nodes, topics, URDF basics

## Why Digital Twins?

Physical humanoid robots are expensive, fragile, and potentially dangerous during development. A fall can destroy actuators worth thousands of dollars. An untested algorithm might cause injury.

Digital twins solve these problems:
- **Safe testing**: Crash the simulated robot thousands of times without damage
- **Rapid iteration**: Test changes in seconds rather than setting up hardware
- **Synthetic data**: Generate unlimited training images with perfect labels
- **Reproducibility**: Share exact test conditions with colleagues worldwide

The challenge is making simulation accurate enough that behaviors transfer to real robots—the "sim-to-real" problem that motivates much of this module.

## Module Structure

| Chapter | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Gazebo Physics | Physics engines, rigid body dynamics, collision |
| 2 | Unity Rendering | Render pipelines, PBR materials, HRI simulation |
| 3 | Sensor Simulation | Ray-casting, depth buffers, IMU noise models |
| 4 | Environment Building | SDF worlds, terrain modeling, asset management |

## The Sim-to-Real Gap

Throughout this module, we address the fundamental challenge: simulated sensors and physics are never perfect. Strategies like domain randomization, realistic noise injection, and validation against real data help bridge the gap between simulation and deployment.
