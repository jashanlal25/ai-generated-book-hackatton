# Contract: Section 5 - Integration: The Complete AI Brain

## Metadata
- **Word Target**: 500 words
- **Priority**: P4
- **Dependencies**: Sections 1-4

## Learning Objectives
1. Synthesize all components into unified understanding
2. Trace data flow from simulation to robot action
3. Identify component responsibilities

## Required Content

### 5.1 End-to-End Pipeline
- Simulation → Perception → Navigation flow
- Role of each component in the pipeline
- Training vs deployment distinction

### 5.2 Component Responsibilities
- Isaac Sim: Training environment + synthetic data
- Isaac ROS: Real-time perception acceleration
- Nav2: Path planning and execution

### 5.3 The "AI Brain" Metaphor
- Perception as "seeing"
- VSLAM as "spatial awareness"
- Navigation as "decision making"

## Required Diagram
End-to-end pipeline showing all components working together.

## Required Citations
- References from previous sections (consolidated)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Synthesizes all components clearly
- [ ] Shows complete data flow
- [ ] Distinguishes training vs runtime
- [ ] Reinforces learning objectives from all sections
