# Specification Quality Checklist: The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity (Module 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Word count constraint | PASS | FR-001 specifies 3,000-5,000 words |
| Source requirements | PASS | FR-002 requires peer-reviewed/official sources |
| APA citations | PASS | FR-003 mandates APA format |
| Diagram requirements | PASS | FR-004 specifies 3+ ASCII diagrams |
| Content scope | PASS | FR-011-013 clearly exclude tutorials, hardware, ethics |
| User stories | PASS | 4 stories with clear priorities (P1-P4) |
| Edge cases | PASS | 3 edge cases with resolutions documented |
| Success criteria | PASS | 7 measurable outcomes defined |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous
- Module 2 builds on Module 1 (ROS 2) and prepares for Module 3 (Isaac Sim)
- Scope boundaries clearly separate this module from adjacent topics

**Checklist Status**: COMPLETE
**Ready for**: `/sp.plan`
